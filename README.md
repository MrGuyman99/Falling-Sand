- Download or clone the repository
- Open to the root directory
- Open a new terminal instance and type the following commands

`md build`\
`cd build`\
`cmake ..`\
`cmake --build .`

That's it! The file should generate as a Visual Stuido Solution file. From here you should just be able to right-click on FallingSand, set it as the startup project\
